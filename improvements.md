## Improvements

this is the list of possible improvements that can be made in this app

1. Configure this module into a proper package that can be deployed on PyPI (using poetry or regular setuptools and twine)
2. Add more styling to the output
3. Improve request sending logic to take into account multiple similar requests (when we request forecasts for mutliple location at once)
